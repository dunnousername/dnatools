# This was originally in the README
I moved it here because it didn't fit the context of the README.

This is basically about why the maintainer chose this license, if anyone cares.

This totally wasn't because I didn't feel like writing code or doing some other productive task.
## What license does this project use?
It uses the MIT license.
## Why not use GPL?
GPL is awful.
## But it's not!
It is.
## Why are you only giving one line answers?
Not sure.
## Really though, why don't you like the GPL?
I think open-source is about helping society, at least to some extent. And society is made of people.

So, I'd rather give people choices to benefit from this project, even if that means they don't share the changes back.

At least for me, if I download something that someone is offering for free, I don't want them to demand I show them what I did with the code.

If your friend gives you a recipe for a vanilla cake, and you make a much better chocolate cake by modifying the recipe, it would still be really weird if your friend knocks on your door and demands the recipe for the chocolate cake.

## Why not use a public domain license?
I think I remember reading somewhere that "public domain" is ill-defined legally, and so in some places you get less freedom with public domain code than you do with e.g. MIT-licensed code.

But I'm not sure.
## If you're not sure, then make it public domain now!
What benefit do you get from that? Pretty much the only thing the MIT license requires for normal use is that you give attribution.

With the chocolate cake example, I think most people would agree that, if you open a chocolate cake store (bakery... ?) and make millions, the least you could do is put your friend's name in fine print somewhere in the store.
